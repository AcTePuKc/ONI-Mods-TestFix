# DevLoader badge artwork placeholder

The DevLoader badge expects four PNGs that ship alongside the DLL:

- `dev_on.png`
- `dev_off.png`
- `mini_dev_on.png`
- `mini_dev_off.png`

Drop the finalized assets into this folder before building; the project file copies any `.png` in this directory to the output.
