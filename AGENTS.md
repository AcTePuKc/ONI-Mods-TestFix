# Maintainer Playbook for Aze's Oxygen Not Included Mods

## Project Overview
- This repository hosts Aze's collection of Oxygen Not Included mods, ranging from UI tweaks like *Better Info Cards* to quality-of-life improvements such as *Default Building Settings* and *Suppress Notifications*. Review the root `README.md` for the complete catalog and distribution links before editing mods or assets.
- Detailed instructions for compiling and packaging the solution live in `src/README.md`. Treat that document as the canonical guide when preparing builds.

## Tooling & Build Workflow
> **Hosted Environment Notice:** The automated workspace for this repository does *not* include the ONI/.NET toolchain. Builds cannot be executed here, so rely on static inspection—manual code review, string/introspection checks, and similar non-runtime validation. Whenever tooling gaps prevent a build or test run, explicitly note the skipped steps (and rationale) in `NOTES.md` and your PR description so follow-up maintainers understand the outstanding work.
> "Clone the repo and install ONI." (`src/README.md`)
>
> "If ONI is not installed in the default Steam location (or your environment differs from the default): In the `Solution Items` folder, add a new `.xml` file named `Directory.Build.props.user`. Copy the contents of `.default` to `.user`. Edit any properties specific to your environment in `.user`." (`src/README.md`)
>
> "Rebuild the solution. Automatically pulls in required packages through nuget. Creates publicized assemblies. If Visual Studio can't find the `_public.dll` assemblies: Restart VS and reopen the solution." (`src/README.md`)
>
> "Debug: Prefixed with `DEV_` ... exported to ONI's `mods\dev` folder. Release: Exported to the Release folder ... Zipped and placed in the Distribute folder." (`src/README.md`)

### Shared Libraries & Helpers
- **Local `Directory.Build.props` overrides** — When configuring a new workstation, copy `src/Directory.Build.props.default` to `src/Directory.Build.props.user` and update the `SteamFolder`, `GameFolder`, and `ModFolder` values so they point at your local installations. These steps mirror the canonical workflow documented in `src/README.md` and ensure subsequent builds generate the `_public` assemblies referenced throughout the solution. The sample paths in the `.default` file are placeholders; replace them with paths valid for your machine before rebuilding.
- `src/Directory.Build.props` automatically references both **AzeLib** and **PLib** for every project in the solution. Review that file before adding new dependencies to confirm the helpers are already included.
- Prefer reusing existing utilities from these shared libraries rather than introducing new helper types. This keeps behavior consistent across mods and avoids duplicate maintenance work.
- AzeLib extension documentation lives under `AzeLib/Extensions/README.md`; skim it when you need to understand or extend existing helpers before writing custom code.

1. **Environment setup** — Follow the quoted steps above to align your build environment, including custom `Directory.Build.props.user` overrides when paths differ.
2. **Rebuild the solution** — Use Visual Studio/MSBuild to restore packages and emit publicized assemblies. Resolve missing `_public.dll` assemblies by restarting VS.
3. **Build outputs** — Expect DEV-prefixed debug builds in ONI's `mods\dev` directory and release zips under `Distribute/`.
4. **Diagnostics** — When instrumenting or benchmarking systems (e.g., `AzeLib` hooks), document findings in `NOTES.md`, and ensure any new DEBUG-only tooling is gated so release builds remain clean.

## Translation Workflow
> "Each translatable mod is a folder... You should see a `_template.pot` file, and any existing `.po` translations." (`Translations/README.md`)
>
> "You may translate through software intended for translation, or with just a text editor." (`Translations/README.md`)
>
> "Do not translate words inside curly braces... Do not translate words inside angle brackets." (`Translations/README.md`)
>
> "Save the file as `[language_code].po`." (`Translations/README.md`)
>
> "Please test your translations to make sure everything works as intended before submitting them... Restart the game so that it can reload translations." (`Translations/README.md`)

- Download `_template.pot` (and relevant `.po`) files for the target mod or use `Translations.zip` for bulk work.
- Translate with Poedit or a text editor while preserving placeholders and formatting markers.
- Finalize the `.po` file using the documented naming and optional attribution pattern.
- **Testing translations** — Inject the `.po` file into the mod's `Translations` folder within ONI's mods directory and restart the game to validate in-context before submitting.

## Tracking & Documentation Conventions
> "This document inventories the current in-code `TODO` comments across the repository. Items may be checked off only after the corresponding in-code `TODO` comment has been removed and the affected behavior has been re-validated through tests or manual verification. Keep this list synchronized whenever TODOs are introduced or resolved." (`ToDo.md`)

- **`NOTES.md`** — Log diagnostics, benchmarks, and investigation summaries with timestamps. Follow the existing structure that captures instrumentation context, measurement status, and next steps (see the dated sections already in the file).
- **`ToDo.md`** — Mirror the quoted policy: keep the tracker synchronized with in-code TODOs and validate behavior before checking items off.
- **Translations** — When adding or modifying `.po` files, note the work in `NOTES.md` if it involved testing or uncovered issues, and ensure translation guidelines above were followed.

## Testing Expectations
- **Mod code changes** — Rebuild the affected projects. When feasible, run automated tests under `tests/` or perform manual validation in-game. Document any blocked testing (e.g., missing runtime) in `NOTES.md` so maintainers can follow up (`NOTES.md` demonstrates how to record unexecuted diagnostics and next steps).
- **Localization changes** — Follow the translation testing workflow to confirm strings render correctly. If game-level validation is impossible, call that out explicitly in your PR and in `NOTES.md`.
- **Diagnostics/Instrumentation** — If adding diagnostics that cannot be executed in the current environment, record the required follow-up steps in `NOTES.md` and create or update entries in `ToDo.md` when action is needed.
- **Runtime verification** — In-game validation steps for features such as *Better Info Cards* are documented so maintainers can execute them in their local ONI installations outside the hosted workspace. Automation agents must continue to flag these runtime checks as skipped and mark them for manual follow-up rather than attempting to reproduce them here.

## Coordination
- After completing work, commit changes and prepare a PR that references this playbook so other maintainers are aware. Use the documented workflows above to keep the knowledge base consistent.
